# Aggregator

This package is responsible for aggregating on-chain data from the Horizon
smart contract and from the SocialDB smart contract, then ingesting it into
our database.

## Flow

Here are the steps which the aggregator performs:

1. Connect to the database and blockchain.
2. Fetch all the projects (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#project-vendor-investor-fetching))
3. Record the state of the projects for activities we want to track
4. Insert all the projects (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#project-vendor-investor-insertion))
5. Fetch all the vendors
6. Insert all the vendors
7. Fetch all the investors
8. Insert all the investors
9. Fetch all the requests (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#requests-fetching))
10. Insert all the requests (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#requests-insertion))
11. Fetch all the contributions (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#contributions-fetching))
12. Insert all the contributions (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#contributions-insertion))
13. Fetch all the claims (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#claims-fetching))
14. Insert all the claims (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#claims-insertion))
15. Delete all deleted claims (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#claims-deletion))
16. Delete all deleted contributions (more details on how this is done can be found
    [here](#contributions-deletion))
17. Delete all deleted requests (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#requests-deletion))
18. Delete all deleted investors (more details on how this is done can be found [here](#project-vendor-investor-deletion))
19. Delete all deleted vendors
20. Delete all deleted projects
21. Capture the state of the projects for activities we want to track
22. Compare state captures before and after the aggregation to check for incentive
    achievements
23. Award projects with achieved incentives

### Fetching

#### Project, vendor, investor fetching

Each of the entities has two components to them:

1. The details stored in the Horizon smart contract
2. The social details stored in the SocialDB smart contract

In order to fetch all the details of all the entities we follow a similar approach
that is abstracted into a trait [`FetchAll`](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/lib.rs#L93).
This trait requires the implementer (project, vendor or investor) to describe how
to get a list of all the account IDs of the entity and how to get the details of
the entity from the Horizon contract.

When this is implemented like in:

- [project.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/project.rs#L219)
- [vendor.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/vendor.rs#L222)
- [investor.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/investor.rs#L149)

The trait provides auto-implementations for fetching details for all of the entities
by iterating over batches of concurrent detail fetching calls to the blockchain which
you can see [here](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/lib.rs#L187).

#### Requests fetching

Requests have two parts just like the above mentioned entities, but unlike those
the second part that makes them is not the SocialDB smart contract data, but
the proposals associated with each requests whose data also lives in the Horizon
smart contract.

In order to fetch all the requests, and each requests proposals with their
respective details, we first need to fetch all the request IDs, [get the details
of each request](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/request.rs#L40),
[get the list of proposals for each request](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/request.rs#L63),
[get the details of each proposal](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/request.rs#L86)
and finally combine that data into a [`FullRequest`](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/request.rs#L131).

#### Contributions fetching

Contributions do not have multiple parts, but they are more complicated to list
as they are grouped by project and vendor pairs.

In order to fetch all the contributions, we first fetch all the project IDs (like
outlined above) so that we can fetch all of their [contribution histories](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/contribution.rs#L79),
and then fetch each [contributions details](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/contribution.rs#L101).

#### Claims fetching

Claims are the simplest to fetch as they only require two steps, namely [listing
out all of their IDs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/claims.rs#L14)
and then [fetching their details](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/5afca679008164a996d60de296f63853b6e0815a/aggregator/src/claims.rs#L31).

### Insertion

#### Project, vendor, investor insertion

All entities are inserted using the same flow, a transaction is initiated and each
entry is flattened and inserted in the appropriate table in the database and at the
end the transaction is committed. This is done for two reasons:

- Only sending one transaction to the database makes this more performant
- In case any insert fails, no entries get inserted preserving the database state

Here are the implementations for each respectively:

- [project.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/project.rs#L107)
- [vendor.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/vendor.rs#L140)
- [investor.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/investor.rs#L87)

#### Requests insertion

Similar to entities, requests are inserted by initiating a transaction and inserting
each entity separately with the addition of creating an array of insertions for all
proposals associated with the request.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/request.rs#L230).

#### Contributions insertion

Contributions are inserted using the same flow as requests, the difference being
that the array of insertions created for each contribution is for each contribution
action rather than proposals.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/contribution.rs#L195).

#### Claims insertion

Claims are the simplest to insert as well, they do not need any flattening and
are inserted in a single transaction too.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/claims.rs#L106).

### Deletion

#### Project, vendor, investor deletion

Entities are deleted by checking the difference between the existing IDs in the
database and the list of all IDs currently in the Horizon smart contract.

Here are the implementations for each respectively:

- [project.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/project.rs#L85)
- [vendor.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/vendor.rs#L118)
- [investor.rs](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/investor.rs#L65)

#### Requests deletion

Requests are deleted by first deleting all proposals which are not currently
listed in the Horizon smart contract, and then all the requests which are not
listed in the Horizon smart contract.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/request.rs#L168).

#### Contributions deletion

Contributions are deleted by deleting all contribution actions for each contribution
not in the Horizon smart contract, and then deleting the contribution entry.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/contribution.rs#L148).

#### Claims deletion

Claims are deleted the same way entities are, since they don't have any foreign
constraints depending on them, by simply deleting all the claims which are no longer
listed in the Horizon smart contract.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/fcf1f7125987b5a35945374dd9881e1172cf95e3/aggregator/src/claims.rs#L76).

### Incentive awarding

Currently only projects are awarded incentives for in app activities.

#### Projects

Compare the two states by iterating over the projects captured after deletion and
calculate any achieved incentives.
Map those incentive achievements into transaction batches for awarding the credits
on-chain.
Broadcast and wait for those incentive transactions to go through.

Here is the [implementation](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon/blob/1bfe622d2c5ff500a7e8de443ab752c5a4471a6d/aggregator/src/project.rs#L338).
